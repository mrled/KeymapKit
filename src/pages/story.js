              <p className="p-1">
                In 2019, I started to feel pain when typing.
                I had had typing related repetitive stress injury (RSI) pain almost a decade before,
                and had managed it into nothing with the help of a registered occupational therapist (OTR).
                This time, the stretches and ice regimen she had given me were not effective,
                and I sought out other treatments.
              </p>
              <p className="p-1">
                RSI can instigate brutal feelings of depression and hopelessness,
                especially if your career depends on your ability to type for many hours as mine does.
                If this is you, I'm so sorry.
                I built this site to show one aspect of my strategy for managing my pain.
              </p>
              <p className="p-1">
                Do note that this is just <em>one aspect</em>.
                I hope to talk more about the other aspects in the future.

                How an ErgoDox helped
              </h2>
              <p className="p-1">
                I would have tried anything to help with the pain.
                My research suggested that trying a split keyboard could help by keeping my shoulders square and,
                along with a desk at the proper height,
                keeping my elbows at right angles.
                I'd founds several options,
                and ultimately decided I wanted to try an
                {" "}<IntraAppLink href="/ergodox">ErgoDox keyboard</IntraAppLink>.
              </p>
              <p className="p-1">
                My brother had an
                {" "}<ExternalLink href="https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/">
                  ErgoDox Infinity
                </ExternalLink>{" "}
                that he had bought in a kit and put together himself,
                and he had been trying to convince me to get one of my own.
                Rather than build a kit myself, though,
                I opted for a preassembled
                {" "}<ExternalLink href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox-EZ</ExternalLink>.
              </p>
              <p className="p-1">
                It turned out that while it was true that my shoulders were more square after I bought it,
                I had not expected a much more significant benefit.
                I could remap every painful key under my pinkies to keys under my thumbs.
                For instance, I moved
                {" "}<IntraAppLink href="/?keyId=l-t-1-3">
                  the shift key
                </IntraAppLink>{" "}
                to an easy location under my left thumb.
              </p>
              <p className="p-1">
                Before this, pinkies on both hands would cause me serious pain.
                They would alternate,
                some days on the right, some days on the left, some both, some neither.
                The finger would naturally curl into what felt like a useless claw,
                and stretching my hand flat would be painful.
                Hitting any key with that finger would cause pain, sometimes sharp pain,
                and chording (e.g. holding shift with a pinky while reaching for a letter)
                was impossible.
                The tendon on the outer side of my forearm,
                that runs from the pinky to the elbow,
                would be swollen and rock hard.
                Grip was difficult.
                Some days I didn't trust my ability to hold a full pint glass with one hand.
              </p>
              <p className="p-1">
                But when I moved the commonly used keys like shift under my thumb,
                the relief was almost palpable.
                Once I got used to the placement, I could type longer.
                I never had grip problems,
                and had pain there much less often.
                It didn't solve RSI for me,
                and I've been working to manage it ever since, with some success but not total victory.
                But just the key relocation really did mean the difference
                between a full week of full days of productivity and a week of misery,
                coming in late and leaving early and trying to find anything to do besides type.
