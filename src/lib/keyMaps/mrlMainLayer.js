const bracketKeyInfo = `
Brackets work really well for me here, and shift keys work really poorly for me here,
so this odd key placement is a win-win for me.

The most important aspect of this placement is that it is <em>not</em> a <kbd>shift</kbd> key.
When I first got my ErgoDox, shifting on either hand had become excruciating,
and I desperately needed to shift without using my pinky.
To accomplish this, I remapped [[l-t-1-3|<kbd>shift</kbd>]].

However, mapping another key shift while also keeping the default shift keys gave me too much of a crutch.
At the same time, on the ErgoDox default layout the <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> keys are in an awkward place anyway,
and the shift keys are actually easier to reach than the default location
for [[r-f-9-9|<kbd>[</kbd>]] and [[r-f-11-9|<kbd>]</kbd>]].

I do not even miss a shift key on the right side of the keyboard when typing,

It's a very commonly used key, and even moreso for Emacs users.
Every key on the keyboard is reachable while holding down this key, and it's very easy to find.
On a normal keyboard, I remap the key in the [[l-f-1-5|<kbd>capslock</kbd>]] position to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>;
for this layout, I had to remove that mapping to stop me from falling back to old habits.
Once I did that, this key works very naturally.

"Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) works great here. It's easy to hit with your thumb,

            Most of the keys on this keyboard are in their default QWERTY location.
            Even for the QWERTY keys, though, there is something special about the ErgoDox layout.
            The keys are <em>ortholinear</em>,
            which means that they are arrayed in neat columns rather than offset like a traditional QWERTY keyboard.
            This means your fingers extend straight out, or curl straight in, to hit any key.

            Towards the center and tilted at an angle, you will notice the <em>thumb clusters</em>.
            This design lets you use the powerful muscles in your thumbs to strike the most commonly used keys.

            Additionally, you can see that the keyboard is actually two independent boards.
            They are connected by a flexible cable, and can be positioned straight in front of your arms.
            This helps keep correct posture and relaxed shoulders.

            Keys highlighted here have been moved from their traditional QWERTY location to relieve pain.

            You'll note that all of them are moved inward,
            such that they are within reach of either the index finger or the thumb.
            <strong>This is the biggest benefit of the ErgoDox for me.</strong>

            I remapped all of these keys in order to relieve what became intense,
            painful strain on the pinky fingers of both hands.
            At its worst,
            the tendon on the outside of each forearm from pinky-side of the palm to the elbow would be swollen,
            rock hard, and painful to touch.
            Touching any keys with my pinkies would feel like tiny stabs of pain.
            It was miserable.

            I am not the first to notice that these keys &mdash;
            <kbd>esc</kbd>, <kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>shift</kbd>, <kbd>backspace</kbd>, <kdb>ctrl</kbd>, and <kbd>return</kbd> &mdash;
            are some of the most commonly used keys on the board,
            and yet we use them with our pinkies, which are the weakest fingers we have.
            Changing the location of these keys has made a massive difference in my day to day life on a keyboard,
            and it was easy to learn.

            Once I changed these keys, my pain decreased drastically.
