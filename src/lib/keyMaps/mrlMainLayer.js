It's nice that you can easily hit arrow keys without moving your hands, and I think it actually makes Emacs/vim keybindings less necessary in apps because of that. Still, surely anyone buying an Ergodox has been using computers long enough to configure Emacs/vim keybindings everywhere. I use these, but don't find them indispensable.";
const pageUpDownHomeEndInfo =
  "An ok position for <kbd>Page Up</kbd>, <kbd>Page Down</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, and <kbd>End</kbd>. Much better than the default Ergodox layout, which shifts these keys down by one, consuming extremely valuable keys [[l-t-5-5|here]] and [[r-t-1-5|here]]. You may or may not find these keys necessary - they tend to be heavily used on Windows (and also in VS Code), and much less useful on macOS. That said, with <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>space</kbd> on opposite hands, <kbd>Page Up</kbd> is the only way you can scroll up one page with only one hand on the keyboard (while on a regular keyboard, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> will do this).";

The default Ergo layout has this [[l-t-5-1|here]] â€” a crazy location for either operating system, in my opinion. It\'s worse on macOS, where every application shortcut uses it. Keeping <kbd>GUI</kbd> here makes it very easy to hit any application shortcut without remapping or straining your hands. The default value for this key is <kbd>hyper</kbd> (as <a class="underline" href="https://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/">described by Brett Terpstra</a>), which is only useful for user-defined shortcuts. While those are certainly useful if available, for my workflow, they are by no means mandatory, and I think there are many other places for a <kbd>hyper</kbd> key if you truly desire one.';

However, mapping another key shift but leaving this as a useful shift key gave me too much of a crutch. At the same time, on the Ergodox default layout the <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> keys are in an awkward place anyway, and the shift keys are actually easier to reach than the default location for [[r-f-9-9|<kbd>[</kbd>]] and [[r-f-11-9|<kbd>]</kbd>]].

Once I did that, this key works very naturally.";
