    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>This site is a visual explanation of my keyboard layout.</p>
    <p>
      The keyboard, an <a href="/ergodox">ErgoDox-EZ</a>, has been a huge part
      of <a href="/story">my strategy for dealing with RSI</a>
      . Maybe it can help you too.
    </p>

    <h2>How did it help?</h2>
    <p>
      The ErgoDox keyboard I have is an important aspect of managing pain from
      long periods of typing. It keeps my shoulders square, and it has a slight
      &ldquo;tenting&rdquo;, which keeps my hands in a more natural orientation
      with my thumbs slightly higher than my pinkies. Most importantly, it has
      allowed me to reduce the intense strain on my pinkies by moving commonly
      used keys out from under weak pinkies to under much stronger thumbs.
    </p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>This is a work in progress.</p>
    <p>
      I&apos;m building it
      <a href="https://github.com/mrled/keymap.click">on GitHub</a>. Issues and
      contributions welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project represents a lot of firsts for me. It is my first project
      with a graphical UI in years, my first ever NextJS or React project, the
      first time I had used Tailwind CSS, the first project I migrated away from
      Tailwind CSS, and the first web project I&apos;ve built with a UI that
      I&apos;m proud of. It&apos;s the best GUI I&apos;ve ever designed. I made
      my first commit May 24, 2020, and I didn&apos;t know a thing about how
      React or Next worked at that time.
    </p>
    <p>And I did it all on my ErgoDox.</p>

    <h1>ErgoDox keyboards</h1>
    <p>
      ErgoDox keyboards are open source keyboards that are designed with
      ergonomics in mind and are entirely customizable. See the homepage of the
      open source ErgoDox project:
      <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">https://www.ergodox.io/</a>. They come
      in several different varieties.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox-EZ</a> pre-assembled boards.
        This is what I have.

        <a href="https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/">

        kits which you solder together yourself.

    </ul>

    <h2 id="qmk">Open source firmware: QMK</h2>
    <p>
      The various types of ErgoDox all use the fantastic open source
      <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK firmware</a>. QMK is a superpower that lets
      me remap <em>any</em> physical button press to <em>any</em> letter,
      character, or even
      <a
        href="https://me.micahrl.com/blog/hack-save-qmk-firmware-source-to-keyboard/"
      >
        sequence of characters
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Most critical for my purposes, I can move a character that a normal QWERTY
      keyboard keeps under a pinkie &mdash; <kbd>escape</kbd>, <kbd>tab</kbd>,
      <kbd>shift</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>return</kbd>,
      <kbd>backspace</kbd>, and more &mdash; to the cluster of keys under the
      thumbs on my ErgoDox. This has been very helpful in
      <a href="/story">my battle with RSI</a>. To see details on this, take
      <a href="/?guide=mrlGuide">the guided tour</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="qmk-layers">Layers in QMK</h2>
    <p>
      One of QMK&apos;s most powerful features is its concept of
      <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_layers">layers</a>, which let you
      transform the entire board at the press of a button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people are probably familiar with a &ldquo;function&rdquo; key, like
      many laptops have &mdash; layers work like that. I have a similar
      <a href="/?keyId=l-f-2-9">function layer</a> on my board. When I hold that
      key, QMK transforms the number keys <kbd>1</kbd> through <kbd>0</kbd> to
      function keys <kbd>F1</kbd> through <kbd>F10</kbd> , transforms other keys
      to controls for multimedia playback or screen brightness, and more. When I
      let go of the function layer key, the board snaps back to normal
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more fun one is my <a href="/?keyId=l-f-8-9">arrow layer</a>. When I
      hold that key, QMK transforms <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>,
      <kbd>f</kbd>, and <kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> ,
      <kbd>l</kbd> into arrow keys, taking inspiration from
      <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/">this blog post</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="my-keymap">My QMK keymap</h2>
    <p>
      I keep the source code for my keymap on GitHub; you can find it
      <a
        href="https://github.com/mrled/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/mrled/keymap.c"
      >
        here
      </a>
      . (Unfortunately, it&apos;s hard to read with GitHub&apos;s stylesheets or
      on a small screen. If you&apos;re reading this on a wide monitor, you
      might find it easier to see it
      <a

    <h1>Personal history</h1>
    <p>
      In 2019, I started to feel pain when typing. I had had typing related
      repetitive stress injury (RSI) pain almost a decade before, and became
      pain-free with the help of a registered occupational therapist (OTR).
      However, this time, the stretches and ice regimen she had given me were
      not effective, and I sought out other treatments.
    </p>
    <p>
      RSI can instigate brutal feelings of depression and hopelessness,
      especially if your career depends on your ability to type for many hours
      as mine does. If this is you, I&apos;m so sorry. I built this site to show
      one aspect of my strategy for managing pain from repetitive stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do note that this is just <em>one aspect</em>. I hope to talk more about
      the other aspects in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>How an ErgoDox helped</h2>
    <p>
      I would have tried anything to help with the pain. My research suggested
      that trying a split keyboard could help by keeping my shoulders square
      and, along with a desk at the proper height, keeping my elbows at right
      angles. I&apos;d found several options and ultimately decided I wanted to
      try an <a href="/ergodox">ErgoDox keyboard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother had an
      <a href="https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/">
        ErgoDox Infinity
      </a>
      that he had bought as a kit and put together himself, and attempted to
      convince me to get one of my own. Rather than build a kit myself, though,
      I opted for a preassembled
      <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox-EZ</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out that while it was true that my shoulders were more square
      when I used it, I had not anticipated a much more significant benefit. I
      could remap every painful key under my pinkies to keys under my thumbs.
      For instance, I moved <a href="/?keyId=l-t-1-3">the shift key</a> to an
      easy location under my left thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this, pinkies on both hands hurt. A lot. They would alternate, some
      days the right hand, some days the left hand, some both, some neither. The
      finger would naturally curl into what felt like a useless claw, and
      stretching my hand flat would be painful. Hitting any key with that finger
      would cause pain, sometimes sharp pain, and chording (e.g. holding shift
      with a pinky while reaching for a letter) was impossible. The tendon on
      the outer side of my forearm that runs from the pinky to the elbow would
      be swollen and rock hard. Grip was difficult. Some days I didn&apos;t
      trust my ability to hold a full pint glass with one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I moved the commonly used keys like shift under my thumb, the
      difference was night and day. Once I got used to the placement, I could
      type longer without hurting. I never had grip problems and had pain there
      much less often. It didn&apos;t solve RSI for me, and I&apos;ve been
      working to manage it ever since, with some success but not total victory.
      But just the key relocation really did mean the difference between a week
      of full productive days and a week of misery, coming in late and leaving
      early and trying to find anything to do besides type.
