# TODOs

* Eradicate all the TODOs I've added to the code
* Add guide back
* Can I keep CSS specific to a web component next to the web component?
* Add support for layers
* Support creating a new key-map-ui element pointing to a specific key or guide step - needs testing
* diamargs seem to start drawing only at the halfway point, see the arrow layer for example, the inner half of the diamarg is empty and on each side all four lines are drawn in the outer half. This bug exists in the React version too.
* Place the key-map-ui in the shadow DOM? not sure of implications here. I would like to allow it to be styled without it being stepped on by the site's code, look into this.
* Update readme
