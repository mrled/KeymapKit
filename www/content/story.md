<h1>Personal history</h1>
<p>
  In 2019, I started to feel pain when typing. I had had typing related
  repetitive stress injury (RSI) pain almost a decade before, and became
  pain-free with the help of a registered occupational therapist (OTR).
  However, this time, the stretches and ice regimen she had given me were
  not effective, and I sought out other treatments.
</p>
<p>
  RSI can instigate brutal feelings of depression and hopelessness,
  especially if your career depends on your ability to type for many hours
  as mine does. If this is you, I&apos;m so sorry. I built this site to show
  one aspect of my strategy for managing pain from repetitive stress.
</p>
<p>
  Do note that this is just <em>one aspect</em>. I hope to talk more about
  the other aspects in the future.

<h2>How an ErgoDox helped</h2>
<p>
  I would have tried anything to help with the pain. My research suggested
  that trying a split keyboard could help by keeping my shoulders square
  and, along with a desk at the proper height, keeping my elbows at right
  angles. I&apos;d found several options and ultimately decided I wanted to
  try an <a href="/ergodox">ErgoDox keyboard</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My brother had an
  <a href="https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/">
    ErgoDox Infinity
  </a>
  that he had bought as a kit and put together himself, and attempted to
  convince me to get one of my own. Rather than build a kit myself, though,
  I opted for a preassembled
  <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox-EZ</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It turned out that while it was true that my shoulders were more square
  when I used it, I had not anticipated a much more significant benefit. I
  could remap every painful key under my pinkies to keys under my thumbs.
  For instance, I moved <a href="/?keyId=l-t-1-3">the shift key</a> to an
  easy location under my left thumb.
</p>
<p>
  Before this, pinkies on both hands hurt. A lot. They would alternate, some
  days the right hand, some days the left hand, some both, some neither. The
  finger would naturally curl into what felt like a useless claw, and
  stretching my hand flat would be painful. Hitting any key with that finger
  would cause pain, sometimes sharp pain, and chording (e.g. holding shift
  with a pinky while reaching for a letter) was impossible. The tendon on
  the outer side of my forearm that runs from the pinky to the elbow would
  be swollen and rock hard. Grip was difficult. Some days I didn&apos;t
  trust my ability to hold a full pint glass with one hand.
</p>
<p>
  But when I moved the commonly used keys like shift under my thumb, the
  difference was night and day. Once I got used to the placement, I could
  type longer without hurting. I never had grip problems and had pain there
  much less often. It didn&apos;t solve RSI for me, and I&apos;ve been
  working to manage it ever since, with some success but not total victory.
  But just the key relocation really did mean the difference between a week
  of full productive days and a week of misery, coming in late and leaving
  early and trying to find anything to do besides type.
