<p>
  ErgoDox keyboards are open source keyboards that are designed with
  ergonomics in mind and are entirely customizable. See the homepage of the
  open source ErgoDox project:
  <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">https://www.ergodox.io/</a>. They come
  in several different varieties.

    <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox-EZ</a> pre-assembled boards.
    This is what I have.

<h2 id="qmk">Open source firmware: QMK</h2>
<p>
  The various types of ErgoDox all use the fantastic open source
  <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK firmware</a>. QMK is a superpower that lets
  me remap <em>any</em> physical button press to <em>any</em> letter,
  character, or even
  <a
    href="https://me.micahrl.com/blog/hack-save-qmk-firmware-source-to-keyboard/"
  >
    sequence of characters
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Most critical for my purposes, I can move a character that a normal QWERTY
  keyboard keeps under a pinkie &mdash; <kbd>escape</kbd>, <kbd>tab</kbd>,
  <kbd>shift</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>return</kbd>,
  <kbd>backspace</kbd>, and more &mdash; to the cluster of keys under the
  thumbs on my ErgoDox. This has been very helpful in
  <a href="/story">my battle with RSI</a>. To see details on this, take

<h2 id="qmk-layers">Layers in QMK</h2>
<p>
  One of QMK&apos;s most powerful features is its concept of
  <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_layers">layers</a>, which let you
  transform the entire board at the press of a button.
</p>
<p>
  Most people are probably familiar with a &ldquo;function&rdquo; key, like
  many laptops have &mdash; layers work like that. I have a similar
  <a href="/?keyId=l-f-2-9">function layer</a> on my board. When I hold that
  key, QMK transforms the number keys <kbd>1</kbd> through <kbd>0</kbd> to
  function keys <kbd>F1</kbd> through <kbd>F10</kbd> , transforms other keys
  to controls for multimedia playback or screen brightness, and more. When I
  let go of the function layer key, the board snaps back to normal
  instantly.
</p>
<p>
  A more fun one is my <a href="/?keyId=l-f-8-9">arrow layer</a>. When I
  hold that key, QMK transforms <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>,
  <kbd>f</kbd>, and <kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> ,
  <kbd>l</kbd> into arrow keys, taking inspiration from
  <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/">this blog post</a>.

<h2 id="my-keymap">My QMK keymap</h2>
<p>
  I keep the source code for my keymap on GitHub; you can find it
  <a
    href="https://github.com/mrled/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/mrled/keymap.c"

    here
  </a>
  . (Unfortunately, it&apos;s hard to read with GitHub&apos;s stylesheets or
  on a small screen. If you&apos;re reading this on a wide monitor, you
  might find it easier to see it
  <a
    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrled/qmk_firmware/master/keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/mrled/keymap.c"
