<p>This site is a visual explanation of my keyboard layout.</p>
<p>
  The keyboard, an <a href="/ergodox">ErgoDox-EZ</a>, has been a huge part
  of <a href="/story">my strategy for dealing with RSI</a>
  . Maybe it can help you too.
</p>

<h2>How did it help?</h2>
<p>
  The ErgoDox keyboard I have is an important aspect of managing pain from
  long periods of typing. It keeps my shoulders square, and it has a slight
  &ldquo;tenting&rdquo;, which keeps my hands in a more natural orientation
  with my thumbs slightly higher than my pinkies. Most importantly, it has
  allowed me to reduce the intense strain on my pinkies by moving commonly
  used keys out from under weak pinkies to under much stronger thumbs.

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress.</p>
<p>
  I&apos;m building it
  <a href="https://github.com/mrled/keymap.click">on GitHub</a>. Issues and
  contributions welcome.
</p>
<p>
  This project represents a lot of firsts for me. It is my first project
  with a graphical UI in years, my first ever NextJS or React project, the
  first time I had used Tailwind CSS, the first project I migrated away from
  Tailwind CSS, and the first web project I&apos;ve built with a UI that
  I&apos;m proud of. It&apos;s the best GUI I&apos;ve ever designed. I made
  my first commit May 24, 2020, and I didn&apos;t know a thing about how
  React or Next worked at that time.
</p>
<p>And I did it all on my ErgoDox.</p>
