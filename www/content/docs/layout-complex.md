See [my early ErgoDox layout](https://github.com/mrled/KeymapKit/blob/master/examples/MicahErgodoxLayout.ts)
for a much more complex layout.

It shows key groupings, guides, and multiple layers.
It's long but pretty repetitive,
so it should be pretty easy to crib from once you understand the simple example.
