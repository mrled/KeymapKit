Here are some example layouts you can use as a reference.

* [examples/MicahErgodoxLayout.ts](https://github.com/mrled/KeymapKit/tree/master/examples/MicahErgodoxLayout.ts):
  a copy of an ErgoDox layout with simple text legends used in this documentation
  (also published as vanilla JavaScript [here](https://me.micahrl.com/blog/earliest-ergodox-keymap/))
* [Micah's 2025 Advantage360 layout](https://me.micahrl.com/blog/advantage360-keymap-summer-2025/),
  consisting of a few different TypeScript files and more advanced legends

If you publish a keymap along with its source code,
feel free to open a PR to include a link here.
More references of working keymaps will help new users get started.
