    tend to be heavily used on Windows and other Microsoft products like
    Outlook and VS Code, and much less useful on macOS.
  `,
  `
    These keys are difficult for me to use without actually looking down at
    the keyboard.
  `,
];

const guiKeyInfo = [
  `
      This key represents either <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> on macOS or
      <kbd>win</kbd> on Windows. Keeping it in this location makes it very easy
      to hit any application shortcut without remapping them in the operating
      system or straining your hands.
    `,
];

const bracketKeyInfo = [
  `
      Brackets work really well for me here, and shift keys work really poorly
      for me here, so this odd key placement is a win-win for me.
    `,
  `
      The most important aspect of this placement is that it is <em>not</em> a
      <kbd>shift</kbd> key. When I first got my ErgoDox, using shift with either
      hand had become excruciating, and I desperately needed to shift without
      using my pinky. To accomplish this, I remapped
      <keymap-indicator id="l-t-1-3">
        <kbd>shift</kbd>
      </keymap-indicator>
      to under the thumb. However, moving shift to a new location without
      removing the normal QWERTY shift mapping gave me too much of a crutch, so
      I needed to remove shift from its normal location.
    `,
  `
      Even so, why brackets? On the ErgoDox default layout, the brackets are in
      an awkward place anyway, and the shift keys are actually easier to reach
      than the default location for
      <keymap-indicator id="r-f-9-9">
        <kbd>[</kbd>
      </keymap-indicator>
      and
      <keymap-indicator id="r-f-11-9">
        <kbd>]</kbd>
      </keymap-indicator>
      .
    `,

const volumeControlInfo = [
  `
    It&apos;s nice to have dedicated volume keys, but isn&apos;t a necessity.
    I&apos;ve also experimented with using these keys to enter different
    function layers, which works well too.
  `,
];

const ctrlKeyInfo = [
  `
      Keeping this key out from under my pinky is vital &mdash;
      <em>especially</em> since I can&apos;t seem to break two decades of Emacs
      habits.
    `,
  `
      Happily, this is a really excellent location for <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, much
      better than the default QWERTY location, and only possible on an ErgoDox,
      because it&apos;s easier to chord with any key on the board.
    `,
  `
      On a normal keyboard, I remap the key in the
      <keymap-indicator id="l-f-1-5">
        <kbd>capslock</kbd>
      </keymap-indicator>
      position to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>; for this layout, I had to remove that mapping
      to stop me from falling back to old habits.

const optKeyInfo = [
  `
      This key represents either <kbd>opt</kbd>/<kbd> ⌥</kbd> on macOS or
      <kbd>alt</kbd> on Windows. This location is easy to hit with your thumb,
      and having two of them means you don&apos;t have to stretch much.
    `,
  `
      As <kbd>opt</kbd> + a left/right arrow key is a very common chord,
      it&apos;s worth noting that this placement works well with my
      <keymap-indicator id="l-f-8-9">left side</keymap-indicator> and
      <keymap-indicator id="r-f-7-9">right side</keymap-indicator> arrow layer keys.
      I can chord <kbd>opt</kbd>+<kbd>arrow layer</kbd> with one thumb without
      any strain, and use the other hand to move the cursor with the arrow keys.
    `,

  `
      Enter an arrow layer, where
      <keymap-indicator id="l-f-8-3">

        <kbd>l</kbd>
      </keymap-indicator>
      are arrow keys.
    `,
  `
      This is a fantastically useful idea that I did not invent. I got
      <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/">the original vision</a> from
      <a href="https://tonsky.me/">Nikita</a>, who has a much nicer website than
      I do. His solution is really good, but I cannot use <kbd>capslock</kbd> to
      activate the arrow layer; on a normal QWERTY keyboard, I must remap that
      key to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, and more importantly I want to avoid chording keys
      with my pinky as much as possible.
    `,
  `
      People more accustomed to the vim way of doing things might prefer
      <kbd>H</kbd> <kbd>J</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>L</kbd> instead of the
      inverted-T arrow placement I use, to which I say, go wild man, be free.

              offset like a traditional QWERTY keyboard. This way, my fingers
